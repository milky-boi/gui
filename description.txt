Introduction
__________

The pandastable library provides a table widget for Tkinter with
plotting and data manipulation functionality. It uses the pandas
DataFrame class to store table data. Pandas is an open source Python
library providing high-performance data structures and data analysis
tools. Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for python. It is intended
for the following uses:

-  for python/tkinter GUI developers who want to include a table in
   their application that can store and process large amounts of data
-  for non-programmers who are not familiar with Python or the pandas
   API and want to use the included DataExplore application to
   manipulate/view their data
-  it may also be useful for data analysts and programmers who want to
   get an initial interactive look at their tabular data without coding


The flyGUI
__________
This is a standalone application for
data manipulation and plotting meant for education and basic data
analysis. Main purpose of this application is analyzing data created from 
monitoring wine fly activity with DAM1 monitor. Data is represented in format
date \tab time \tab activity1 \tab activity2 \tab ...
On first screen user browse for datat. 
After loading data in app User opoens Data Selection screen and selects
flies(columns) and time period(rows). Columns can only be selected 
as series(E.g. 1,2,3,4) not separated(1,3,6,9) inthis version. 
The user is offered the possibility of saving the data in .txt and .xlsx format.
User can select up to 4 individual data frames, this is created becouse experiment where
we measure data can have phases. 

On second screen Data Visualizaton results form selected data are represented.
Results can be represented for each individual fly or entire population. 

statistical values are calculated (average, sum and standard deviation).
For population Average (average movement in each row), Sum(total movement in eachrow).
For each we take transposed table so we get time as columns and in each row is fly activity data.

Data is representedin graphs which can be saved.
